# PY-Lung-Cancer-Prediction-GUI
Lung cancer prediction application, Tensorflow NN, CTk GUI.



This application uses Kaggle Dataset Lung-Cancer, which provides one csv file with 16 columns and ~300 rows each containing information about people tested for lung cancer.

Data is split into test and train datasets. Train contains about 75% of data, while test contains the rest (25%).

Results are being predicted using a neural network with 4 layers,

A preprocessing normalization layer,

two layers with 10 neurons and a ReLU activation function,

and a final layer with 1 neuron and linear activation function.

Train accuracy: 96.97%

Test accuracy: 96.67%
